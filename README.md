# Simple-Network-Messaging-System
This project is a simple messaging system that demonstrates key network programming concepts in Java. It includes a TCP server for message storage and backup, a UDP server for broadcasting announcements, and a P2P client for direct chat between users. The system features a graphical user interface (GUI) where users can send and receive messages, view announcements, and back up their local chat history to the server.

Features:

ðŸ§  TCP Server: Accepts client messages, saves them to a text file, and echoes them back.

ðŸ“¢ UDP Server: Broadcasts announcements to all listening clients.

ðŸ’¬ Peer-to-Peer Chat: Clients can connect directly to exchange messages.

ðŸ’¾ Chat Backup: Upload local chat history to the server.

ðŸªŸ Client GUI: Displays announcements, chat window, and backup controls.

Technologies:
- Java (Sockets, Threads, File I/O, GUI â€“ JavaFX)
- TCP/UDP networking
- Text-based message storage
